To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored
at.
The git remote add command takes two arguments:
1. A remote name, for example, origin
2. A remote URL, for example, https://<your-git-service-address>/user/repo.git
   git remote add origin https://<your-git-service-address>/owner/repository.git
